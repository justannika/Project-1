# Hobby Page 

Link:

**##Aim**  
This is to show off my hobby/instagram account where I post reels and photos of food and cooking. 

##Features  
This has links to my instagram account where I post food I've made - click on each picture to take you to the corresponding reel.
Would like to have each button at the top link to other parts of the site

##Stack 
1. Html
2. CSS
3. Javascript
4. 

##Layout and Design

##Issues  
Making site responsive - got help from Gio at the support group.  
Gio recommended that I wrap my h1 element in a container / div and have a read through the complete guide to flexbox to help with the responsiveness
